            <h2>Fun with the Family during the pandemic</h2>
            <p>My adult son and daughter came back to St. Louis at the beginning of the pandemic, and everyone worked from our home.</p>

               <h2>Sourdough Bread</h2>
               <p>This was my nephew's pet project.  We acquired a sourdough starter from a friend, a cast iron pot, a banneton basket, and a few other accoutrements.  He experimented with different ratios of flour to water, and went through 17 different trials. The rest of the family was happy to taste the trials!</p>
